# Trailblazer Audio Announcement
##### A plugin for [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/)
The Leagues 2: Trailblazer jingle can now accompany your collection log and combat diary pop-ups!

A **huge** thank you to [C Engineer Completed](https://github.com/m0bilebtw/c-engineer-completed) for a lot of the code used. Please install their plugin it's much funnier than mine.

Thank you to the [Leagues discord](https://discord.com/invite/vbhPUHU) for keeping me entertained while Leagues itself is not going on.

## Note: You must turn on the chat indicators for Collection Log in your Settings for the sound effect to play!
